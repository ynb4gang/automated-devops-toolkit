# Automated DevOps Toolkit

## Overview

The **Automated DevOps Toolkit** is a powerful suite of tools designed to simplify and automate common DevOps tasks. With components for CI/CD pipeline generation, cloud resource management, Docker image handling, Kubernetes deployments, and monitoring, this toolkit provides a one-stop solution for developers and DevOps teams looking to enhance their deployment processes.

## Features

- **CI/CD Pipeline Generator**: Automatically generates CI/CD configuration files for popular platforms (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).
- **Cloud Resource Management**: Manages provisioning and configuration of cloud resources across multiple providers (AWS, GCP, Azure).
- **Docker Management**: Facilitates the creation, building, and pushing of Docker images to registries.
- **Kubernetes Deployment Management**: Simplifies the creation of Kubernetes deployment manifests.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Integrates Prometheus for metrics monitoring and provides structured logging for applications.
- **Notification and Alerting**: Sends notifications via Slack and email for critical events and alerts.
- **Resource Management and Auto-Scaling**: Monitors resource usage and implements auto-scaling based on predefined thresholds.
- **Configuration and Secrets Management**: Securely retrieves and manages configurations and secrets from AWS Secrets Manager or Kubernetes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the Automated DevOps Toolkit, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Docker
- Kubernetes (Minikube or a cloud-based Kubernetes service)
- Access to a Prometheus server for monitoring (optional)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ynb4gang/automated_devops_toolkit.git
   cd automated_devops_toolkit
   ```
2. Install required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Configure your cloud provider credentials and Kubernetes context if necessary.
   Set environment variables for configuration management:

   ```bash
    export CONFIG_SOURCE=aws  # or kubernetes
   ```

   For AWS, ensure your AWS credentials are configured properly (via ~/.aws/credentials).

### Usage
#### 1. CI/CD Pipeline Generation:
  To generate a CI/CD pipeline configuration, run:
  ```bash
  python ci_cd/generator.py
  ```
#### 2. Cloud Resource Management:
  To manage cloud resources, use:
  ```bash
  python cloud_manager/cloud_manager.py
  ```
#### 3. Docker Management:
  For Docker operations, execute:
  ```bash
  python docker/docker_manager.py
  ```
#### 4. Kubernetes Deployment:
  To create a Kubernetes deployment, run:
  ```bash
  python kubernetes/deployment_manager.py
  ```
#### 5. Monitoring and Logging:
  Start the monitoring and logging setup with:
  ```bash
  python monitoring/monitor.py
  ```
#### 6. Notification System:
  To set up notifications, run:
  ```bash
  python notification/alert_manager.py
  ```
#### 7. Resource Management and Auto-Scaling:
  Start the resource manager:
  ```bash
  python scaling/resource_manager.py
  ```
#### 8. Configuration Management:
  To retrieve configuration and secrets, run:
  ```bash
  python config/config_manager.py
  ```

### Examples
Example for CI/CD Configuration Generation:
  ```bash
  python ci_cd/generator.py --template your_template.yaml
  ```
Example for Scaling Configuration:
  
  Modify the scaling parameters in scaling/resource_manager.py to suit your application needs.

### Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps to contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (git checkout -b feature/your-feature).
3. Make your changes and commit them (git commit -m 'Add some feature').
4. Push to the branch (git push origin feature/your-feature).
5. Open a pull request.
